<h1>The Art Dealer Game</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Art Dealer Game is a simulation designed to teach K-8 students computational thinking, math concepts, and computer science fundamentals. The game emulates the role of an art dealer, where students must discover patterns in the cards (representing paintings) that the dealer is buying. The goal is to progressively challenge students with increasing complexity in the patterns, fostering learning and engagement.
</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>This game is designed for three distinct age groups:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Grades K-2</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Grades 3-5</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Grades 6-8</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Game Mechanics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The dealer (computer) has a specific pattern of cards they are looking to buy.</li>
    <li>Students (players) must select 4 cards per turn and observe what the dealer buys.</li>
    <li>After each turn, students can make a guess from a provided list to identify the pattern.</li>
	<li>Students have a total of three attempts to choose different cards and identify the pattern.</li>
    <li>If the guess is correct, balloons fly across the screen as a visual reward, and a cheer sound plays.</li>
    <li>Players can start a new game after either winning or three failed attempts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>K-8 Adaptive Game Complexity</strong>: The game adjusts to the age group, with more advanced patterns for older students.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual and Audio Feedback</strong>: Balloons and sounds enhance the engagement and reward students for correct guesses.</li>
    <li><strong>Educational Focus</strong>: Emphasizes computational thinking and math in a fun, interactive environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Patterns in the Game</h2>
<p>Patterns are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>K-2</strong>: All four cards are either all diamonds, hearts, spades, clubs, black, red, Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, 10s, 9s, 8s, 7s, 6s, 5s, 4s, 3s, or 2s.</li>
    <li><strong>3-5</strong>: Add all the K-2 functions along with single digit primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11 (Jack), 13 (King), sums to 9, ace and black jacks.</li>
    <li><strong>6-8</strong>: All of K-2 and 3-5 along with similar poker functions: One Pair, Three of a Kind, straight, straight flush.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Ensure Java 1.8 or newer is installed on your system.</li>
    <li><strong>Clone the repository</strong>:
        <pre>git clone git@github.com:prithukathet/Project-SoftwareEngineering.git</pre>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Run the application</strong>:
        <ul>
            <li>Open the project in an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).</li>
            <li>Compile and run the project from the main class.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Select your grade level (K-2, 3-5, or 6-8).</li>
    <li>The game will display a set of playing cards.</li>
    <li>Choose 4 cards identified by the checkmark and submit them.</li>
    <li>The dealer will either buy all, some, or none of the cards.</li>
    <li>Guess the dealerâ€™s pattern from a list. You have 3 guesses!</li>
    <li>If correct, balloons fly, and a cheer sound plays.</li>
    <li>After either winning or 3 failed attempts, it will ask you to start a new game or quit.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to Use Jar File</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Utilize BASH:</li>
    <pre>java -jar .\softwareengineeringassignment.jar</pre>
    <li>Ensure Java is installed and added to your system's path.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Jar File</h3>
<p>A JAR file is a package file format used to distribute Java applications or libraries. It combines multiple .class files, resources, and metadata into a single, compressed file. JAR files make it easy to share or execute Java programs across different environments.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Java 8 or higher.</li>
    <li>No external libraries are needed.</li>
    <li>Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit (JDK).</li>
</ul>
